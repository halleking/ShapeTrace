# Daisy Doodles
A simple early development game for children to help practice writing and drawing skills developed with Unity/C#. An engaging way to teach numbers and counting, the alphabet, and shape recognition. 

## How to Play
On a touchscreen device, use your finger to trace the shape on the screen. On a computer, click and drag your mouse to follow the paths. As you trace the shapes, seeds are planted and when the shape is successfully filled in, your flowers bloom!
